# Blockchain-based-resilient-storage
This project aims towards security and prevention of any undesired manipulation of sensitive public data(such as real estate property or shareholders of a company). The project uses Ethereum block-chain based distributed computing platform, which is an API for building decentralized(server-less) application on which data can be stored as well as computation can be performed.  We coded up a smart contract(in Solidity, a language for block-chain apps) with javascript on the front end for users to enter data and into the block-chain and also perform transactions on the block-chain which get reflected in almost real time(after they get mined!) on the ropsten network.
